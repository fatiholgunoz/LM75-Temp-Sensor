# LM75-Temp-Sensor-

A microcontroller circuit that measures temperature from a sensor and sends data to a PC using the UART.
This project uses an I2C system in addition to ADC, UART, and combinations.
A red LED was added to show that the potentiometer is working,
both for easy debugging and because we are making an online presentation
